      <h1>Take a tour of the Red River Gorge Geological Area!</h1>

      <p>The Red River Gorge was established in 1937 by the United States Forest Service, and was designated a U.S. National Natural
        Landmark in 1975.  At 29,000 acres, much of the park area is located in the Daniel Boone National Forest and is host to thousands of 
        visitors every year. Containing more than 100 natural sandstone arches, Red River Gorge has become one of the top rock climbing 
        destinations in the world. In addition to more arches than you could see in a day, the park offers high sandstone cliffs, waterfalls, 
        rock shelters, camping, ziplining, and even <a href="https://www.gorgeunderground.com/">underground boating and kayaking tours</a>!   
     </p>
      
     <p>
      The goal of this project is to visualize the area created by the Red River.

      <h2>Relative elevation model of the Red River</h2>
      <h5>An REM is a relative elevation model. These maps are used for easily identifying changes in the stream channel over time. 
        This particular model shows the area surrounding the river that is over 20 feet in elevation.</h5>

        This map shows a fly-over of the road leading to Natural Bridge, 
        with a quick detour up the mountain to the top and over the ridge. 
        The bridge is located in Red River Gorge in the Daniel Boone National Forest.
